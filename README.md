**Lilium Salvation** is a fork of [Lilium Arena](https://github.com/zturtleman/lilium-arena) for running [Dark Salvation](https://mangledeyestudios.itch.io/dark-salvation) by Mangled Eye Studios.

Lilium Salvation has only been tested with Dark Salvation 1.06. I have that latest Dark Salvation 1.07 (which is avaialble at [itch.io](https://mangledeyestudios.itch.io/dark-salvation)) but I haven't got around to testing it.

Lilium Salvation code commits: [compare/upstream...master](https://github.com/zturtleman/lilium-salvation/compare/upstream...master)

The engine support was reimplemented without the original source code and may not be network/demo compatible (though neither seem to work anyway). The source code for the Dark Salvation game, cgame, and ui code is not included as has not been released; instead the QVMs in the data files are used.

## Compiling

Lilium Salvation is compiled using `make`. For details see [building ioquake3](http://wiki.ioquake3.org/Building_ioquake3) and the [ioquake3 readme](README-ioq3.md).

The Visual Studio and Xcode project files are not supported.
